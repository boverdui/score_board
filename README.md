# Programming & Web Fundamentals

Over the next week you have the chance to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

- Ruby fundamentals
- TDD (where appropriate)
- OOP
- Web Programming ( REST/MVC )
- Databases with CRUD actions

## Score Board

Instead of choosing one of the four provided project briefs, I chose to build a website to replace the Excel spreadsheet I use to administer details about the rugby matches I have attended.

### MVP:

- Create new matches and teams
- Display a list of all matches
- Colour team scores according to result (win, draw, lose)
- Full CRUD functionality for matches and teams
- Sort matches by date, competition, venue, or teams

### Possible Extensions:

- Create new competitions and venues
- Full CRUD functionality for competitions and venues
- Filter matches by search term
